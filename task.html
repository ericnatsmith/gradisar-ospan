	  <p>In this task, you will solve simple math problems while you also
	    try to memorize words you see on the screen.</p>
	  <p>You will be given a set of math problems and words to
	    remember. For each math problem, you will see an equation and you
	    will have to decide it is correct or incorrect. It is VERY important
	    to solve the problems as quickly and as accurately as possible. Once
	    you make your decision, a word will appear on the screen. Then, the
	    next math problem will appear, then the next word, and so on. At the
	    end of the sequence, you will have to type in all words in that
	    order they appeared.</p>
